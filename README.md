# Decision Tree And Random Forest
This project demonstrates the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning for multiclass classification. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its sepal and petal measurements.

Key highlights:

Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest models for classification

Data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

Visualization of feature importance to interpret model predictions

This project is ideal for beginners to understand tree-based algorithms and how they handle multiclass classification problems.
